/**
 * Given an array of numbers, returns an array of 100-based percentages those numbers take up of their sum. Undefined indexes in the array are ignored, but passed back when returned (to keep indexes consistent).
 * You can also pass a `total` to this function, which will be used to calculate percentages (instead of the sum)
 *
 * @example ```
 * calculatePercentages([60,50,undefined,20,70]) === [30,25,undefined,10,35]
 * ```
