			<div>
				<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p>
				<p>
					My interest in technology has always been a theme in my life. Starting with
					programming books in eighth grade and evolving into building computers and
					interning at my school's IT department, my knack for technology led me to pursue
					an Information Technology degree at the University of Toledo. There, I gained
					exposure to various tech fields, but it was web development that resonated with
					me the most.
				</p>
				<p>
					This interest grew into a passion as I taught myself advanced JavaScript and
					engaged in personal projects. Today, web development is more than a hobby; it's
					the path I want to take in my professional life. With a blend of formal
					education and self-directed learning, I'm ready to start my career in the tech
					industry as a web developer.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p style={{ marginBottom: '0px' }}>
					<strong>So, are you a front end developer? Or are you full stack?</strong>
				</p>
				<p style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
					I am a <u>front end developer with back end capabilities</u>. Much of my
					knowledge resides in front end technologies (React, TypeScript, Sass, etc.), but
					I also know Relational Database tech (SQL) very well. I can also create
					type-safe APIs using Node.js and Express.js, though my backend knowledge doesn't
					extent too far past that currently.
